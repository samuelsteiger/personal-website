    <p>Hi! My name is Samuel Steiger, I am an aspiring software engineer from Wading River, New York. I love to work on personal projects in the areas Iâ€™m interested in such as social media and market analysis to sharpen my skills and grow. My formal education is in Computer Science, which I had the pleasure of studying at Stony Brook University. I hope to get the opportunity to work on exciting new projects in the future and collaborate with smart and inventive people.</p>
